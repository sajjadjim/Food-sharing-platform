# Food Sharing Platform — Client (React + Vite)

A minimal, fast, and modern React client template powered by Vite. This repository is designed for building the frontend of a food-sharing platform with instant HMR, sensible defaults for linting, and a clear path to TypeScript if you need type safety.

## Highlights

- Blazing-fast development with Vite and HMR
- ESLint configured for consistent code quality
- Easy migration path to TypeScript and type-aware linting
- Works with either Babel- or SWC-based React plugins for Fast Refresh

Recommended React plugins:
- @vitejs/plugin-react (Babel-based)
- @vitejs/plugin-react-swc (SWC-based)

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

2. Start development server
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Build for production
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4. Preview production build locally
    ```bash
    npm run preview
    ```

## Available Scripts

- dev — Start the Vite dev server with HMR
- build — Create an optimized production build
- preview — Serve the built app locally for verification
- lint — Run ESLint and report problems
- format — Run Prettier or your chosen formatter (if configured)

Adjust scripts in package.json to match your package manager and tools.

## TypeScript & Linting

For production apps, consider enabling TypeScript and type-aware linting using typescript-eslint. There are templates and guides to add TypeScript to a Vite React project. Enabling types will help catch many classes of bugs earlier.

## Environment

Place runtime configuration in a .env file (Vite supports VITE_* prefixes for client-exposed variables). Example:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
```

## Deployment

Build artifacts in the dist/ folder. Deploy to any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.). Configure the provider to serve the index.html and route unknown paths back to it for client-side routing.

## Contributing

- Fork and create a feature branch
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Run linting and tests locally before opening a PR
- Add a short description and screenshots when relevant

## License

Choose an appropriate open-source license for the project (e.g., MIT) and include a LICENSE file.

Enjoy building the Food Sharing Platform client — fast iteration and clean structure are the goals!
